<h3 id="create">Create your digital garden</h3>

If you already have Jekyll on your pc, all you have to do is **make a copy of [Lilium template reposiory from GitHub](https://github.com/crixer18/lilium-digital-garden-jekyll)** and use it to create a new website.

To make a copy of the repository I suggest you to "fork" mine, so you can find the Lilium template in your GitHub account.

![GitHub clone repository](/imgs/how-to-1.png)
    
In this image you can see my repository's. Yours will be similar but intead of "crixer18/giardino" there will be your user name and the name of the repository which contains the template.

From there you can clone the repository on your pc using terminal.

![Locally copy a github repository](/imgs/how-to-2.png)

In your case, the link in red will be the one you copied from GitHub repository (previous image). The string in blue is the name of the new folder you're going to create, in which the template will be downloaded.

At this point, you've created the site. You can enter the directory (with $cd my-digital-garden or whatever is the name you chose), and test the Jekyll site on localhost:

![Create Jekyll website](/imgs/how-to-3.png)

Then:

![Locally run Jekyll wbsite](/imgs/how-to-4.png)

Watch the result: open [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser.

It was easy, wasn't it?

<h3 id="publish">Publish your digital garden</h3>

The last thing you need to do, if you want it, is to publih your digital garden. When youâ€™re ready to go online, one thing you need to know is that there are **a lot of different services to host a Jekyll site**, free ones and premium ones. You can publish directly on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or you can chooes another one. [Here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/third-party/)'s a list of sites you can use.

**Now you can [start to customize](/docs/start-personalizing.md) your digital garden**. ðŸ’¡
