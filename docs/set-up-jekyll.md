# How to set up Jekyll

![jekyll](/imgs/jekyllrb.png#noshadow)

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator. You can install it on your Windows or Linux pc or MacOS. It might seem tricky at first, but I’ll tell you exactly what to do.

### Prerequisites

Before you install Jekyll you have to make sure that some tools are already installed on your pc. To do that, you need to **open the shell (Terminal)** and then follow the instructions you can find on [this page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

If something is missing, you can download and install it from:

* **[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)**
* **[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)**
* **[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)**
* **[Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)**

### Install Jekyll

When you have everything you need, you may proceed with the installation of Jekyll and bundler gems.

Write on your terminal:

![install jekyll and bundler gems](/imgs/how-to-7.png)

Now, you can [download and install Lilium Digital Garden](/docs/set-up-lilium.md) and start your first Jekyll site using this template.
