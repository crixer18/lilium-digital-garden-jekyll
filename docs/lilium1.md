<h3 id="digital-gardens">What do you mean by digital garden?</h3>

A **digital garden** is a personal-public space where you can keep track of thoughts, experiences, the little things we find out every day. You can write down new ideas, add images, projects, bookmarks, anything you want. Think of it like a **digital white skchetchbook** (or, in this case, green) where you're completely free to create and develope your interests.

<h4 id="not-a-blog">Why not a blog?</h4>

Because **it's simpler**. Instead of using blogging services or CMS, with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) you can easily create static web site. Plus, **it's free** and open source, you can find the whole template package on [GitHub](https://github.com/crixer18/lilium-digital-garden-jekyll), you can personalize it and share it. Also, you don't have to pay for hosting if you don't want to, thanks to services such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

<h4 id="not-social-networks">Why not social networks?</h4>

Because **you deserve more**. A digital garden allows your creativity to express both with contents and site customization. You don't have to follow a grid or a policy, you can create your own style. 

<h4 id="edit-and-upgrade">Edit and upgrade it</h4>

The thing that I personally love the most about digital gardens is the possiblity to edit and upgrade the notes everytime I want. **It's cool to change your mind**. When I'm working it happens all the time, and it's the only way I can grow and achieve my goals.

ðŸŒ± **Notes are like little seeds of new ideas that one day will bloom**. Whether you have a creative job like me, or you just like to express yourself, whether you want to write a novel or just eat healthier, being able to change is always useful.

<h3 id="with-lilium">How can I do that?</h3>

With **Lilium Digital Garden** you can focus completely on the content, work on yourself and on your goals.

You don't have to worry about the code because I already took care of it. **I'm going to help you on every step of the way** while you get to create and customize your own digital garden. If there are any problems with the installation or the template itself you can pull a request on [GitHub](https://github.com/crixer18/lilium-digital-garden-jekyll). If you have further questions, you can write me an [email](mailto:web@zulianis.eu).

First of all, I need to know whether if you have ever used Jekyll before.

**[Yup!](/docs/set-up-lilium.md) ~ [Not really...](/docs/set-up-jekyll.md)**
