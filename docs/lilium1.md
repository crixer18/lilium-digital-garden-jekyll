<h3 id="digital-gardens">What do you mean by digital garden?</h3>

A **digital garden** is a personal-public space where you can keep track of thoutht, experiences, discoveries and all the good things that happen around you every day. You can write down new ideas, add images, projects, bookmarks, anything you whant. Think of it like a **digital white schetchbook** (or, in this case, green) where you're completely free to create and develope your interests.

<h4 id="not-a-blog">Why not a blog?</h4>

Because **it's simpler**. Instead of using blogging services or CMS, with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) you can easily create static web site. Plus, **it's free** and open source, you can find the whole template package on [GitHub](https://github.com/crixer18/lilium-digital-garden-jekyll), you can personalize it and share it. Also, you don't have to pay for hosting if you don't want to, thanks to services such as [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

<h4 id="not-social-networks">Why not social networks?</h4>

Because **you deseve more**. A digital garden allows your creativity to express with both contents and site personalization. You don't have to respect a grid or a policy, you can create your own. 

<h4 id="edit-and-upgrade">Edit and upgrade it</h4>

The thing that I personally love most about digital gardens is the possiblity to edit and upgrade the notes everytime I want. **It's cool changing your mind**. When I'm working it happens all the time, and it's the only way I can grow and achieve my goals.

ðŸŒ± **Notes are like lil' seeds of new ideas that one day will bloom**. Whether you do a creative work like me, or you just like to express yourself, whether you want to write a novel or just eat healthier, beng able to change can be really useful for you too.
