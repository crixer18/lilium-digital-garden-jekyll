As you can see, Lilium is a very simple template, similar to a blog, but there's still a lot you can change to make this digital garden *your* digital garden.

<h3 id="start">Where to start</h3>

There are some basic features that you need to override before you go public. This is the only time you'll see the code, I promise.

<h4 id="sitetitle">Title</h4>

The first thing you need to do is change the name of the site from "Lilium Digital Garden" to **the actual name of your digital garden**.

To do so, you have to open the file named "_config.yml" whit a text editor. On the very first line you'll find the name of the site, you just change that and save the file. Then you'll prbably need to serve the site again, as I explained [here](set-up-lilium.md) (if you're running it locally this means stop it and then run "**bundle ecex jekyll serve**" again, then reload the page).

<h4 id="topnav">Top navigation</h4>

Top navigation is **the simple menu you see above the title**. There you can add more pages, but for now, I suggest you to just delete the "Document" and the "Download Lilium" links.

To do so, you have to open the "_includes" folder, and then open the "nav.html" with a text editor. You'll find a list of four links, all you have to do is delete these last two and save the document.

<h4 id="about">About page</h4>

One more thing you'll obviously edit is the "About" page. There you can add your personal information, such as bio, contacts and so on. Down on this page you'll find some tips on how to write on a Jekyll page (such as sintax etc).

Remember that the content of the "About" page is written inside **the "about.md" document in the "_pages" folder**. ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you edit this document and NOT the "about.html" document in the "_layouts" folder.

<h4 id="floating">Floating elements</h4>

The floating elements are:
1. the "About me" block you se on right bottom corner of the pages,
2. the social icons on the "About" pages.

These, of course, contains more personal informations. To edit them you'll have to edit **the "floating-about.html" document and the "floating-social.html" document inside the "_includes" folder**.

For the floating about, you just replace the text between the "<p>" tag and the "</p>" tag with your own text.

For the social icons, you'll just replace my social urls with yours. I provided some other icons that are not displayed (such as LinkedIn, YouTube, Pinterest, Reddit and Twitch) inside the "assets/icons" folder. To replace them you'll just have to type the name of the social in this space.

Or you can add or remove icons by duplicate or delete a whole block contained between the "<li>" and the "</li>".

_**We're done!**_ üéâ

Last thing you can do, if you want, is delete the "docs" folder and all the "how-to-number.png" images from the "imgs" folder, so you can start your brand new digital garden.

<h3 id="tips">Useful Tips</h3>

Now you're free to do whatever you want with your digital garden. But before my job is done, let me give you just a couple of tips that will probably make you spare some time.

Jekyll is an amazing tool, but there are some basic rules that you'll learn soon. One of them is **the language**. In Jekyll we write in a language called *markdown language*, and that's why your notes are stored in files that have the ".md" extention.

Markdown is pretty easy to learn, it's just a combination of symbols actually, like "#" for titles, single "*" for italic and double for bold, and so on. Anyway, il could be useful to start to take a look at a [guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).

To make it even easyer, I suggest you to download a proper text editor, like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), that can help you with syntax mistakes. When you'll be ready, you'll discover how many amazing things you can create by mixing markdown with some HTLM.

Another thing that you should probably know is that creative does not mean messy. It's much easier use a Jekyll site if its directories are in order. So, when you create a new note, you should put it **in the "_notes" folder**. This way, it will apprear in the "Seeds" section, which is a blog-style list of your entries. [Here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) you can find a lot of information on that page, such as how to change the order of the displayed notes. In any case, I suggest you to take a look at the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) documentation.
